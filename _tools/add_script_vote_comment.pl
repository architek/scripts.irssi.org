# This script will post a comment on GitHub with the script name and
# description. The Javascript on https://scripts.irssi.org will
# download all issue comments from the repo and show the GitHub
# "Comment Votes" as votes for the script.

# Requirements:

# - cpan Mojolicious
#
# - Credentials for the GitHub website must be stored in a file
#   `../.votes.pass' with the following format:
#
#   pass: your-github-personal-access-token-abcdef
#   user: github-username

# Usage example:

# Many *manual* steps are required.
#
# 1. The issue must already exist on GitHub.
#
# 2. It should be closed.
#
# 3. Its title should be "votes".
#
# 4. It should not contain more than 72 comments (= scripts)
#
# 5. At the end of every issue, manually post a "follow-up issue" link.
#    Example: (in issue #41)
#    Comment: #42
#
# 6. Run the script:
#    ./_tools/add_script_vote_comment.pl scriptassist.pl 41
#
#    If the script ran successfully, it will output:
#
#    scriptassist.pl
#    201
#
#
# 7. The "follow-up issue" link must be manually delete and re-created
#    after running the script, so that it stays the very last comment.
